The `sims` directory contains a collection of pre-built simulations
using the pyems API. Their main purpose is to make it possible for
users to get commonly needed results (e.g. find the right transmission
line width for a given characteristic impedance) without needing to
write the simulation themselves. They provide the additional benefit
that they serve as a collection of examples for users intending to
write their own simulations.
